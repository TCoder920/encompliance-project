 Introduction   
Minimum Standards  
The minimum standards tell you (the child care operation permit holder) what requirements you, your 
employees, and your caregivers must follow.  
These minimum  standards:  
● were developed by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) with the assistance of 
child-care operations, parents, stakeholders, and other experts in a variety of fields;  
● reflect what the citizens of Texas consider reasonable and minimum;  and 
● meet the guidelines set forth in Chapter 42 of the Texas Human Resources Code (law) for what must 
be included in the minimum  standards.  
The Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act requires that proposed minimum standards be 
published  for public comment before they are adopted as rules. All members of the public, including 
providers, are encouraged to provide input when proposed minimum standards are published for public 
comment. The  commission considers recommendations from interested persons or groups in formulating 
the final draft, which is filed as rules with the Secretary of State.  
Deficiencies  
A deficiency is any failure to comply with a minimum standard, rule in Texas Administr ative Code Chapter 
745, law, specific term of the permit, or specific condition of probation or suspension.  
Weights  
The minimum standards and rules are weighted based on a common understanding of the risk to 
children presented if the standard or rule is vi olated. The weights are high, medium -high, medium, 
medium -low, and low. The assigned weights do not change based on the scope or severity of an 
actual deficiency. Scope and severity are assessed by Child Care Regulation (CCR) staff, 
documented, and conside red in conjunction with the weight when making CCR decisions. You will 
see the weight is noted at the end of each standard or subsection in green. Only those minimum 
standards and rules which can be cited as a deficiency are weighted. For example, the mini mum 
standard prohibiting physical discipline is weighed but standards that are definitions are not 
weighted.  
Revised: 01/2025

7 Maintaining Compliance  
It is essential that you, your employees, and your caregivers recognize four critical aspects of CCR’s 
efforts to protect th e children in care and to help operation employees and caregivers comply with 
the law, rules, and standards. The four aspects are:  
●Inspection
●Technical  assistance
●Investigations
●Caregiver’s rights and entitlements
The Inspection  
Various aspects of regulated operations are evaluated for compliance with the minimum standards, 
rules, and law during regular inspections. The emphasis on these inspections is to prevent risk to 
children in care. The frequency of inspections will fluctuate depending on the type of permit and the 
operation’s history of compliance with the minimum standards, rules, and law.  
During any inspection, if we find that your operation does not meet minimum standard, rule, or law, 
the deficiencies are discussed with the person in charg e at the time of the inspection. You will be 
given an opportunity to correct deficiencies within a specified period of time. If you have questions, 
concerns, or disagree with the citation, we encourage you to talk with us before we leave your 
operation. If  your concerns are not resolved, you may request an administrative review.  
Technical Assistance  
We are available to offer consultation to potential applicants, applicants, and permit holders 
regarding how to comply with minimum standards, rules, and laws. While we most often provide 
technical assistance during inspections and investigations, technical assistance can be requested at 
any time.  
The Child Care Regulation section of the HHSC website has a Technical Assistance Library that allows 
you to view or d ownload information about a variety of topics related to child care. You can view it 
by going to https://hhs.texas.gov/doing -business -hhs/provider -portals/protective - services -
providers/child -care-licensing  and selecting Technical Assistance Library from t he Resources section.  
A feature of the minimum standards publication are the Technical Assistance boxes that follow certain 
minimum standards to provide additional guidance, clarification, resources, and/or best practices related 
to the applicable rule.  
Revised: 01/2025

8 
 Investigations  
When a report alleges a violation of minimum standards, rule, or law, CCR must investigate the 
report, notify you of the investigation, and provide a written report to you of the investigation 
results within prescribed time frames.  
When a report alleges abuse, neglect, or exploitation, the Department of Family and Protective Services 
must investigate the report, notify you of the investigation, and provide a written report to you of the 
investigation results within prescribed  time frames.  
Your Rights and Entitlements  
Waivers and Variances  
You may request a waiver if your operation is unable to comply with a standard for economic 
reasons. You may request a variance if your operation wishes to meet the intent of a standard in a 
way that is different from what the standard specifies. Waiver and variance requests are submitted 
through your online provider account or made in writing to your assigned CCR inspector.  
Administrative Review  
If you disagree with a CCR decision or action, you may request an administrative review, during 
which you are given an opportunity to show compliance with applicable minimum standard, rule, 
law, action, permit restriction(s) and/or permit condition(s).  
Appeals  
You may request an appeal hearing on a CCR  decision to deny an application, revoke, suspend, or 
refuse to renew a permit or a condition placed on the permit after initial issuance.  
Appeal hearings are conducted by the State Office of Administrative Hearings (SOAH).  
For Further Information  
It is im portant that you, your employees, and your caregivers clearly understand the purpose of 
minimum standards and the reasons for CCR’s inspections and investigations. Do not hesitate to ask 
us questions that will help you understand any aspect of our regulati on. You may obtain information 
about minimum standards or procedures by calling your local CCR office or by visiting the HHSC 
Website at https://hhs.texas.gov/doing -business -hhs/provider - portals/protective -services -
providers/child -care-licensing .

Technical Assistance  
• Research has shown children’s physical, social, emotional, and intellectual 
development and safety depend on consistent, caring interaction between children 
and their caregivers.  
• Regarding paragraph (3)(A), administrative duties are tasks that involve meeting 
the business needs of a child -care center, s uch as bookkeeping, enrolling children, 
answering the main office telephone, giving tours to prospective families, etc. A 
caregiver who is engaged in these tasks is not fully available to meet the health 
and safety needs of the children in care, including supervising children and 
preventing situations that could result in a child getting hurt . 
• Regarding paragraph (3)(C), janitorial duties include those tasks outlined in 
§746.123(39). As with administrative duties, a caregiver who is engaged in these tasks 
is not fully available to the children in care and is unable to supervise and interact with 
them in a way that meets their needs and keeps them safe . 
• Regarding paragraph (3)(D), a child -care center may assign an electronic device, such as a 
tablet, t o a caregiver or classroom so that the caregiver can record daily attendance, 
document a child’s day, take photographs for parents, etc. However, the caregiver cannot 
use any electronic device (whether personal or center -owned) for personal reasons,

including physical proximity and auditory or visual awareness of each child’s on going 
activity as appropriate [High] ; and  
(5) Being able to intervene when necessary to ensure each child’s safety [High] . 
(b) In deciding how closely to supervise a child, the caregiver must consider:  
(1) The child’s chronological age;  
(2) The child’s current stage of development;  
(3) The child’s individual differences and abilities;  
(4) The indoor and outdoor layout of the operation;  
(5) The circumstances, hazards, and risks surrounding the child; and  
(6) The child’s physical, mental, emotional, and social needs.  
Technical Assistance  
• Supervision is basic to the prevention of harm. Parents have an understanding that 
caregivers will supervise their children in their absence. Adults who are attentive and 
who understand young children’s behaviors are in the best position to saf eguard  their 
well-being.  
• Child-care centers can also establish an understanding with parents regarding who 
(when the parent and when the center) is responsible for the child while the  parent 
and the child are both on the grounds . These understandings could be laid out in the 
enrollment  agreement.  
• Regarding paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2), the caregiver must always know which children

(a) Each caregiver and the child -care center director must have a current certificate of training 
with an expiration or renewal date in pediatric first aid with rescue breathing and choking. 
[Medium -High]  
(b) Each caregiver and t he child -care center director must have a current certificate  of training 
with an expiration or renewal date in pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). A new 
caregiver does not have to have a current certificate in pediatric CPR before having 
unsupervised access to a child in care. However, the operation must have at least one 
employee or caregiver on the premises while children are in care that has a current certificate 
in pediatric CPR. [Medium -High]  The pediatric  CPR: 
(1) Must adhere to the guidelines for CPR for a layperson established by the American Heart 
Association, and consist of a curriculum that incudes use  of a CPR manikin and both 
written and hands -on skill -based instruction, practice, and testing [Medium -High] ; and

 Technical Assistance  
• According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, knowledge of pediatric first  aid, 
including management of a blocked airway and rescue breathing and the 
confidence to use these skills, are critically important to the outcome of an 
emergency  situation.  
• The Pediatric CPR training obtained from resources that meet the criteria in 
paragraph  (b)(1)  will help ensure  that the techniques  and information  the caregiver 
receives is up to  date.  
• Due to the risk of fraudulent CPR and First Aid courses, the American Heart 
Association (AHA) recommends individuals check with their employer about the 
course completion cards the employer accepts before paying anyone for CPR and 
First Aid courses. The AHA further clarifies: “ The American Heart Association does 
not approve training courses created by other organizations, does not allow its 
course completion cards to be given to stud ents who do not complete the skills 
check portion of American Heart Association training, and there are no “AHA -
compliant” training courses or “AHA -certified” professionals conducting training. An 
organization that has been approved to issue cards with the  AHA logo upon 
successful completion of an AHA training course should display the “Authorized 
Training Center” logo to help you know they are authorized.”

• The training should include the number of clock hours that are allocated to each 
topic; and  
• The training hours an individual obtains through the program should be a realistic 
reflection of the time it takes the individual to complete the training. For example, 
a block of 150 clock hours of training could not realistically be obtained in 10 days, 
as this would require 15 hours of training each day. However, an individual could 
reasonably complete the 150 clock hours over a period of 50 days if the individual 
dedicated three hours per day to completing relevant coursework

A group of children is defined by the number of children assigned to a specific caregiver or group of 
caregivers, occupying an individual classroom or well -defined physical space within a larger room. 
Each child in any group has two things in common with every other child in his group: the sam e 
caregiver(s) responsible for the child’s basic needs and the same classroom or activity space. 
Generally, the group stays with the assigned caregiver(s) throughout the day and may move to 
different areas throughout the child - care center, indoors and out . The group may not mix freely 
with other children, unless specific criteria are met as specified in this subchapter. The number of 
children who may be in a group varies according to the age of the children and the number of 
caregivers as specified in this  subchapter.

Yes. More than one group of children may oc cupy a room, provided the following conditions are met:  
(1) The room is divided so that groups are separated. For example, a group of 25 children and 
another group of ten children may be cared for in the same room if the placement of shelves, 
accordion doors, or low movable walls divide the area so that children in one group do not 
freely mix with children in another group  [Medium] ; 
(2) Groups may move from one activity area to another within the room during the day, but 
individual children may not freely mingle be tween groups [Medium] ; and 
(3) The total number of children must not routinely exceed the room capacity  based on activity 
space.  [Medium]

Subchapter E, Child/Caregiver Ratios and Group Sizes  
Division 1, Ratios and Group Sizes at the Child -Care Center 
September 2003  
In determining child/caregiver ratio, the following apply:  
(1) Child/caregiver ratio is based on the specified age of the children in the caregiver’s group or 
the age of the youngest child in the group, depending on the activity and  the number of 
children at the child -care center.  [Medium]  
(2) You may use the developmenta l or emotional age, rather than the chronological age, of a child 
with special care needs, if this is recommended by a health -care professional or other qualified 
professional and is documented in the child’s record.  [Medium]  
(3) You must consider the skills of the  caregiver and the needs of the individual children and the 
group when assigning a caregiver to a group of children. For example, if a group of toddlers is 
experiencing biting, consider assigning a caregiver who is trained to handle these beha viors 
and perhaps additional caregivers or volunteers to assist in the supervision and redirection of 
the children.  [Medium]  
(4) You must include all children in care, including children related to the child -care center director 
and employees.  [Medium]  
Revised: 01/2025

113 
 (5) In emer gency situations, you may use child -care center employees who do not meet caregiver 
qualifications for a limited time while a substitute caregiver is being secured. The time must 
be no longer than is reasonably necessary to secure a qualified  substitute caregiver. 
Emergency situations include, but are not limited to, illness, accident, or death. [Medium]  
(6) The total number of children in care at the center and in care away from the center, such as 
during a field trip, must never exceed the licens ed capacity of the center.  [Medium -High]  
Technical Assistance  
Regarding paragraph (2), it can be beneficial to adjust the child to caregiver ratio if you have a 
child or children in care with special care needs. A child who may require additional supervis ion or 
care may require more individualized attention or benefit from a smaller group.

 Technical Assistance  
• Adults must be more actively involved in the supervision of children under 24 
months due to their limited muscle control and physical skills. Children under  24 
months are also at greater risk during an emergency requiring evacuation of the 
center.  
• Research indicates direct, warm, social interactions between adults and children 
are more likely to occur with lower child/caregiver  ratios.  
• According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), caregivers must be 
recognized as performing a job for groups of children that p arents would rarely be 
considered capable of handling alone. Caring for a group of three infants is the  same 
as caring for infant triplets; four toddlers can be the equivalent to a set of 
quadruplets.

Subchapter E, Child/Caregiver Ratios and Group Sizes  
Division 2, Classroom Ratios and Group Sizes for Centers Licensed To Care for 13 or More 
Children  
September 2003  
Identify the specified age of the children in each group using this formula:  
(1) List all of the children in the group in order of their ages from youngest to oldest. Children 
younger than 24 months should be listed by their age in months. Children  two years and older 
are listed by their age in  years.  
(2) Determine the total number of children in the group and divide this number by two.  If the 
result is not a whole number but is .5, such as 6.5, round up to the next number, which is 7. 
This will be the core number of the  group.  
(3) Begin counting at the first or youngest child on your list and count down the list from 
youngest  to oldest,  until you reach  the core number.  The age of this child is the specified age 
of the children in this  group.

months and older?  
Subchapter E, Child/Caregiver Ratios and Group Sizes  
Division 2, Classroom Ratios and Group Sizes for Centers Licensed To Care for 13 or More 
Children  
March 2023  
You may combine infants with children 18  months and older in the following situations.  
(1) If you have 13 or more children in care, you may combine infants with older children as long as the 
oldest child in the group is not more than 18 months older than the youngest child. For example, if 
the young est child in a group is eight months old, the oldest child in the group must not be more 
than 26 months old;  [Medium -High]  or 
(2) If you have 12 or fewer children in care you may combine infants with older children without 
regard to age, as described in §746.1 703 of this subchapter (relating to If I have 12 or fewer 
children in care, may I combine infants with children 18 months and older?).  
Technical Assistance  
• There are some programs that offer what is called “continuity of care” for infants and 
toddlers. This is where a mixed age group made up of children between the ages of 
birth through 35 months is cared for together from the time they enroll in the center 
until they turn three. Benefits of this arrangement include consistency in caregivers 
in a setting that resembles siblings within a family, as well as developmental and 
curricular  advantages.  
• When infants are infrequently grouped with older children in a space not  specifically 
designed to meet their needs and without additional caregivers the re is increased 
risk to their health and  safety.

Technical Assistance  
Research has shown that when caregivers have fewer children to supervise and the 
group size is limited it reduces the likelihood of injuries and illness in children and 
increases opportunities for positive interaction with children. Excessive numbers of 
young children increase the danger of high caregiver stress and loss of control.

• Child-care programs can be a great  resource for parents who have questions about their 
child’s development and specialized services available in the community. In order to best 
serve parents who have questions about their child’s development, a child -care center 
should make available to pa rents information regarding early intervention services in the 
community. Access to such information enables parents to request an evaluation of their 
child’s development from experts who are qualified to assess the child’s development and 
recommend approp riate services for the child. Early Childhood Intervention Services  (ECI) 
has additional information regarding the specific services they provide, as well as locations 
in your community.  
• If a child’s parent has shared with the child -care center an Individualized Educational 
Program (IEP) from a school district or an Indiv idualized Family Service Plan (ISFP) from 
ECI, the child -care center should make every effort to incorporate the plan, where 
applicable, into the child’s daily activities.  
• The child -care center is not responsible for the purchase or maintenance of adaptive  
equipment recommended for a child . 
• The child -care center is not responsible for ensuring ECI or another qualified service 
provider visits the operation to provide services. However, the child will receive the 
benefit of services in a natural environment and the caregiver will learn methods for best 
serving the child when the center encourages caregivers to incorporate ECI or another 
service provider into classroom activities .

• Regarding paragraph (1) and outdoor  play: 
o For an infant from birth through 12 months of age, there is no recommended 
total minutes of outdoor  play; 
o You may divide the total minutes of outdoor play into shorter time frames that  
total 60  minutes;  
o You may accommodate weather and air quality by adjusting the scheduled  outdoor  
play, the length of time outdoors, and children’s clothing;  
o When you shorten or cancel outdoor play to accommodate weather or air quality,  
you should increase the time of indoor physical activity, so the total amount of 
physical activity remains the same;  and 
o You should incorporate opportunities to actively enjoy physical activity into part -
time programs by prorating these requirements accordingly (e.g., 20 minutes of 
outdoor play for every three hours at the  center).  
• Regardi ng paragraph (2) and active play: Opportunities for active play may overlap 
with outdoor play and do not need to be counted separately (e.g. 30 minutes of active 
outdoor play that includes moderate to vigorous physical activity may be counted 
toward the re quired 60 or 90 minutes of active  play).  
• Regarding paragraph (2) and active play, you may prorate these requirements if you 
operate a part -time program. To prorate active play, allow 20 minutes of play for 
every three hours children are in care.  
• Outdoor play provides for greater freedom and flexibility, fuller expression through 
loud talk, and a greater range of active movement. Outdoor play also extends 
opportunities for large muscle development, social -emotional development, and small

 Technical Assistance  
• The requirements for screen time activities are consistent with the  Caring for 
Our Children: National Health and Safety Performance Standards, 4th  Edition . 
• For children  under  the age of two, no media  time is recommended  since during  
the first  two years  of life children’s  brains  and bodies  are going  through  critical  
periods of growth and development. It is important that very young children 
have positive social interactions with their parents and caregivers instead of 
through media  time that takes away from these vital  interactions.  
• Excessive media use has been associated with lags in achievement of knowledge 
and skills, as well as negative impacts on sleep, weight, and social and emotional 
health.  
• Children should view screen time activities with an adult who can help the  
children apply what they are learning to the world around  them.  
• Research  indicat es that screen  time is most appropriate  and offers  the most 
benefit when children are actively engaged with the content they are viewing. 
Labeling objects, identifying people on screen, and asking questions are all active 
viewing strategies that maximize children’s learning during screen  time.  
• Caregivers serve as role models and should not be using digital media that is not 
directly involved in the care of children. Also see §746.1203(6)(D) of this 
chapter, which does not allow caregivers to use p ersonal electronic devices, such 
as cell phones, tablets, and video games that are not directly involved in the 
teaching, care, or supervision of children in  care. 
• Regarding paragraph (c)(3), the one hour limit on screen time does not apply  
to field trips away from the  center.  
• Regarding paragraph (d), homework refers to assignments given by a child’s 
public, private, or charter school teacher that are intended to be completed outside 
of regular school hours. Homework does not include work assigned by the child -
care center.  
§746.2209. Must I post the activity plan?

 Technical Assistance  
• Regarding paragraph (1), children learn best from adults who know and respect  
them and with whom they have established a trusting relationship. Individual 
attention received during the early years of life is crucial to an infant's emotional 
and social development. Studies of infant behavior show that infants have 
difficulty forming trusting relationships in settings where many adults interact with 
the infant. The overall health and well -being of an infant can be positively 
impacted by providing infants with the same caregiver(s) on a regular basis.  
• Regarding paragraph (3), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)  
recommends that the wishes of children, regardless of their ages, should 
always be respected with regard to physical contact and their 
comfort/discomfort with it. If a child indicates that the child d oes not wish to 
be held or comforted, even  “friendly  contact” with a child should be avoided.  
• Regarding paragraph (6), a commercial choke tube or empty toilet paper roll can  
be used to test toys and objects in the room that an infant or toddler may easily 
choke on. Try to place the toy or object into the tube. If the object easily passes 
through the tube, an infant or toddler may choke on it and such toys or objects 
must be removed from the children's access. If the object cannot pass through 
the tube, an i nfant or toddler is not likely to choke on  it. 
§746.2403. How must I arrange the infant care area?  
Subchapter H, Basic Care Requirements for Infants

The room arrangement of the infant care area must:  
(1) Make it possible for caregivers to hear all infants and see all infants at a glance, and 
be able to intervene when necessary  [High] ; 
(2) Include safe, open floor space for floor time play  [Medium -High] ; 
(3) Separate infants from children more than 18 months older than the youngest child in 
the group, except when 12 or fewer children are in care, as required by §746.1605 of 
this chapter (relating to May I combine infants with children 18 months and older?) ;

Infants need calm environments away from the stimulation of older children. Placing 
cribs far enough apart to prevent one i nfant from reaching into the crib of another 
infant protects the safety of the infants. This spacing also reduces the likelihood of 
transmission of infectious respiratory diseases spread by large droplets, generated by 
a sneeze or cough, and can be effecti ve in controlling the spread of other infectious 
diseases in the child care environment.

or activities include blankets or quilts for floor or supervised tummy time, crib and 
play gyms, variety of light -weight balls, and pillows or supportive equipment for those 
learning to sit up.  [Medium -High]  
Technical Assistance  
• Each infant should follow an individual schedule  that will vary based on the infant’s 
individual needs, but caregivers should offer a variety of opportunities that aid in the 
development of social, cognitive, and motor skills. Participation in activities will be 
dependent on the ability and developmenta l level of each individual infant. For 
example, a developmentally appropriate physical activity for a younger infant is 
supervised tummy time, as this helps the infant develop neck and shoulder muscles. 
However, once an  infant is crawling, alternate physic al activities become more 
appropriate to develop motor skills and tummy time is no longer  necessary.  
• Regarding paragraph (3) of this section and supervised tummy time, caregivers 
should begin tummy time with infants for short periods of time (3 – 5 minutes), 
increasing the amount of time as the infant shows the infant is enjoying the  activity.  
• You should always encourage the least restrictive environment when  
planning activities for  infants . 
§746.2419. Are there specific requirements for feeding 
infants?  
Subchapter H, Basic Care Requirements for Infants 
April 2017  
Yes. You must: 
(1) Hold infants birth through six months while feeding them  [Medium -High] ; 
Revised: 01/2025

153 
 (2) Hold infants over six months who are unable to sit unassisted in a high chair or  other 
seating equipment while feeding them  [Medium -High] ; 
(3) Never prop or support bottles with some object. The infant or an adult must hold  the 
bottle  [High] ; 
(4) Provide regular snack and meal times for infants who eat table food  [High] ; 
(5) Ensure infants no longer being held for feeding are fed in a safe manner  [Medium -
High] ; 
(6) Label bottles and training cups with the infant's first name and initial of last name  
[Medium -High] ; 
(7) Never allow infants to walk around with or sleep with a bottle or training cup 
[Mediu m- High] ; 
(8) Never use the hand -washing sink or diaper -changing surface for food preparation, or 
for washing food service/preparation equipment, bottles, pacifiers or toys [Medium -
High] ; and  
(9) Sanitize high chair trays before each use.  [Medium -High]  
Technical A ssistance  
• Regarding paragraph (3), research has shown that propping bottles can cause 
choking, aspiration, and increased risk for development of ear infections, tooth 
decay, and injuries to the teeth, as well as depriving infants of much -needed 
face- to-face interaction.  
• Regarding paragraph (8), using diaper changing surfaces and hand -washing 
sinks for food preparation or for washing items used for food service increases 
the spread of germs from cross  contamination.  
§746.2421. What written feeding instructions must I obtain 
for an infant not ready for table food?  
Subchapter H, Basic Care Requirements for Infants 
April 2017  
(a) For an infant  who is not yet ready  for table food, you must obtain  and follow written  
feeding  instructions  that are signed  and dated  by the infant's  parent or health -care 
professional.  [Medium]  
(b) You must review and update the feeding instructions with the parent every 30 days 
until the infant is able to eat table food.  [Medium]  
Revised: 01/2025

154 
 Technical Assistance  
• Regarding paragraph (a), “table food” refers to non -baby food and regular, non -
pureed meals and snacks provided to other children in the child -care center. If 
parents, rather than the child -care center, provide meals, written feeding 
instructions are still required because infants  not yet ready for table food have 
rapidly changing nutritional needs. The amount of formula or breastmilk, baby 
cereal, and types of baby food changes multiple times throughout the infant’s 
early stages. Infant caregivers must have updated information to ensure they are 
feeding each infant according to the current needs of the infant . 
• Written feeding instructions ensure that all caregivers, including substitutes,  
have clear instructions for feeding infants. Each infant's needs vary greatly 
during this critical time of growth and  development.  
• Reviewing and updating feeding instructions every 30 days ensures that  
caregivers are following parent instructions as the nutritional needs of the 
infants  change.  
§746.2423. Must I provide a regularly scheduled naptime 
for infants?  
Subchapter H, Basic Care Requirements for Infants

§746.2426. May I allow infants to sleep in a restrictive 
device?  
Subchapter H, Basic Care Requirements for I nfants 
March 2023  
(a) If you do not have a Sleep Exception Form that includes a signed statement from a 
health -care professional stating that the child sleeping in a restrictive device is 
medically necessary:  
(1) You may not allow an infant to sleep in a restrictive device [High ]; and  
(2) If an infant falls asleep in a restrictive device, you must remove the infant from the 
device and place the infant in a crib as soon as possible [High ]. 
(b) You may allow an infant to sle ep in a restrictive device if you have a completed Sleep 
Exception Form that includes a signed statement from a health -care professional stating 
that the child sleeping in a restrictive device is medically necessary.

(a) You must place an infant in a face -up sleeping position in the infant's own crib, unless 
you have a completed Sleep Exception Form that includes a signed statement from a 
health -care professional stating that a different sleeping position for the child is 
medically necessary [High] . 
(b) An infant who is developmentally able to roll from back to stomach and stomach to back 
may do so independently after you have placed the infant in a face -up position for sleep.  
Technical Assistance  
• Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), the sudden and unexplained death of 
an infant, is the major cause of death in babies between 1 and 4 months old. 
After 30 years of research, scientists still cannot find a cause for SIDS; 
however, research has found the risk of SIDS may be  reduced by placing a 
healthy infant on his or  her back to  sleep.  
• If the infant was born with special care needs, has gastroesophageal reflux, often 
spits up after eating, or has a breathing, lung, or heart problem, a doctor or nurse 
may recommend a different sleep position to use . 
• Providing “tummy time” several times each day is important because it prepares 
infants for the time when they will be able to slide on their bellies and crawl. 
The caregiver needs to stay near and closely supervise the infa nt during tummy  
time.  
• If applicable, a copy of the Sleep Exception Form should be kept in the  
infant's classroom for easy review by caregivers and licensing staff.  
• For additional information, see the CDC webpage Safe Sleep for Babies . 
§746.2428. May I swaddle an infant to help the infant 
sleep?  
Subchapter H, Basic Care Requirements for Infants 
April 2017  
You may not lay a swaddled infant down to sleep or rest on any surface at any time unless 
you have a completed Sleep Exception Form that includes a signed statement from a 
health - care professional stating tha t swaddling the child for sleeping purposes is medically  
necessary. [High]  
Revised: 01/2025

157 
 Technical Assistance  
• If applicable, a copy of the Sleep Exception Form should be kept in the 
infant's classroom for easy review by caregivers and licensing staff.  
• There is evidence that swaddling can increase the risk of serious health 
outcomes, including SIDS and hip disease, and research does not provide 
definitive data to support the use of swaddling. Even with newborns, research 
does not provide conclusive data about whether swaddling should be used. 
Swaddling blankets that become loose during sleep pose an additional risk for 
infants. For concerns with maintaining an infant’s temperature, appropriate 
clothing and/or a sleeveless infant sleep sack that does not r estrict the 
infant’s movement can be utilized. For more information on safe sleep, see 
the American Academy of Pediatrics Health Initiatives for Safe Sleep  and the 
National Institutes of Health Safe to Sleep Campaign . 
§746.2429. If an infant has difficulty falling asleep, may I 
cover the  infant’s head or crib?

(5) A brief summary of the activities in which the infant participated.  [Medium]  
Revised: 01/2025

158 
 Technical Assistance  
Because infants are not able to communicate essential information to their parents, it 
is important that the caregiver do so. In child -care centers, several caregivers may 
care for an infant or there may be a shift change. A report for each parent will allow 
the parent to know how their infant spent the day, so the parent can supplement the 
infant’s activities, meals and so on at home, based on the infant's activities. This is a 
very good way of creating solid communication and healthy relationships with parents, 
and it enhances the prote ction and well -being of infants.

April 2017  
Caregivers must:  
(1) Promptly change soiled or wet diapers or clothing  [Medium -High] ; 
(2) Thoroughly cleanse a child with individual cloths or disposable towels. You must discard any 
disposable towels after use and launder any cloths before using them again  [Medium -High] ; 
(3) Ensure that a child is dry before placing a new diaper on the child. If the child must be dried, 
you must use a clean, individual cloth or disposable towel to dry the child. You must  discard  
the disposable  towel  after use and launder any  cloth before  using  it again  [Medium -High] ; 
(4) Not apply powders, creams, ointments, or lotions unless you obtain the parent’s written 
permission.  If the parent  supplies  these  items,  permission is  implicit  and you do not need to 
obtain permission for each use  [Medium -High] ; 
(5) Label powders, creams, ointments, or lotions with the individual child’s name  [Medium] ; and  
(6) Keep all diaper -changing supplies out of the reach of children.  [Medium -High]  
Technical Assistance  
• A pleasant attitude while changing a child’s diaper, even if a child has had a  loose 
stool, helps to develop a child’s positive sense of  self. 
• Wipes are helpful in removing residue, such as food off a baby’s face or  feces 
from a baby’s bottom during diaper  changing.  
• Parents need to give permission before over-the-counter creams or powders  are used. A 
parent can address whether the child has a skin allergy or if a child’s pediatrician does 
not recommend use of topical products when diapering. Caregivers may seek written 
permission to use these products befo re the need arises.

(b) You must not use areas that children come in close contact with during play or eating, such as 
dining tables, sofas, or floor play areas, for diaper changing. [Medium -High]  
(c) If the diaper -changing table or surface is above the floor level, then at  all times when the child 
is on the  table/surface:  
(1) There must be a safety mechanism (such as raised sides) that is used  [Medium -High] ; 
(2) The caregiver's hand must remain on the child [Medium -High] ; or 
(3) The caregiver must be facing the child and within an arm's length  of the child.  [Medium -

(d) Caregivers with open wounds and/or any injury that inhibits hand washing,  such as casts, 
bandages, or braces, must not change diapers.  [Medium -High]  
(e) You must sanitize the diaper -changing surface after each use. However, if you are changing 
diapers on a number of children consecutively, you may cover the surface with a non -
absorbent paper liner that is disposed of between each  diaper change. [Medium -High] 
(f) You must cover containers used for soiled diapers or keep them in a sanitary manner, such as 
placing soiled diapers in individual sealed bags.  [Medium -High]  
(g) You must place soiled clothing in a sealed plastic bag to be sent home with the child.  
[Medium -High]  
Technical Assistance  
• Recommendation: Assembling all of the supplies necessary for a diaper change 
before bringing the child to the changing table ensures the protection of the child. 
If the hand- washing sink is not adjacent to the diapering area, wipes may be  used, 
as a tempo rary measure only, to clean the caregiver’s and child’s hands while 
supervising the child on the changing  table.  
• During diaper changing, a child’s hands often stray into the area of the child’s body 
covered by the diaper. Germs are contained in human waste  and body fluids and 
are present on the skin and the diaper even if they cannot be seen. Washing an 
infant’s or child’s hands after each diaper change helps reduce the spread of 
germs.  
• Because of the risk of splashing, and gross contamination of hands, sin ks, and 
bathroom surfaces, rinsing diapers or clothes soiled with fecal material in the child - 
care setting  increases  the risk that you, other  caregivers,  and the children  would  be 
exposed to germs that cause  infection.  
• Rotating 2 changing mats throughout the day, using one while another is  sanitized 
and dries, provides an alternative to waiting between diaper  changes.

The specific immunizations needed as an adult vary on such factors including age, 
overall health as well as persons you are in close contact with. Some immunizations 
given  during adulthood may  include:  
• Influenza (Flu) – this immunization helps protect against the flu. When 
determining  if a flu shot is required some factors to consider are people at a 
higher of risk of  severe flu and persons with close contact with others who are at a 
higher risk of flu including persons w ho care for children younger than 12 months 
of age. 
• HepA (Hepatitis) – this immunization helps protect against the hepatitis A 
disease. Factors to be considered when determining the need for the HepA 
immunization can include anyone who will be in close contact with a person or 
child from a country  that has high rates of Hepatitis  A. 
• Pertussis (Whooping Cough) – two immunizations known as DTap and Tdap help 
protect against this disease. Whooping cough is very contagious and most severe 
for babies. F actors to consider when determining the need for this immunization 
include determining the level of risk associated with certain persons and 
caregivers who are in close contact with infants. It is important to understand 
that whooping cough is usually spre ad by coughing or sneezing and many babies

§746.4901. What type of surfacing must I have under my active 
play equipment?  
Subchapter U, Indoor and Outdoor Active Play Space and Equipment 
Division 5, Surfacing  
December 2010  
(a) There must be loose -fill surfacing material or unitary surfacing material in the  use zones (area 
around and under equipment where resilient surfacing is ne eded to prevent serious injury 
from occurring as result of a fall) for all climbing, rocking, rotating, bouncing, or moving 
equipment, slides, and swings.  [Medium -High]  
(b) The height of the highest designated play surface on the equipment will determine the d epth 
of loose materials or the attenuation rating (thickness) of the unitary materials.  [Medium -
High]  
Technical Assistance  
• Studies have shown that falls to the surface are the leading cause of playground 
injuries in children. Shock -absorbing surfaces can help disperse the momentum of a 
falling body or head, thus reducing the risk of life threatening injuries.  
• Construction, use, and any recommended surfacing material for plastic playset 
equipment should be in accordance with man ufacturer specifications. Plastic playset 
equipment includes play structures composed from hollow or solid plastic intended for 
play by pre -kindergarten age and younger children.  
§746.4905. What are acceptable loose -fill surfacing materials?  
Subchapter U, Indoor and Outdoor Active Play Space and Equipment 
Division 5, Surfacing

Loose -fill surfacing materials include, but are not limited to, loose particles such as sand, pea gravel, 
shredded wood products, and shredded rubber. [Medium-High]  
Revised: 01/2025

256 
 Technical Assistance  
Child Care Regulation does not endorse one type of loose -fill surfacing over another. Child -care 
centers should consider the developmental and chronological age of the children using the active play 
equipment when selecting a surfacing material as some materials may be more appropriate for older 
children and preschoolers than toddlers.  
§746.4907. How should outdoor loose -fill surfacing materials be 
installed?  
Subchapter U, Indoor and Outdoor Active Play Space and Equipment 
Division 5, Surfacing  
April 2017  
(a) You must install and maintain loose -fill surfacing materials to a depth  of: 
(1) At least six inches when the height of the highest designated play  surface is five feet or 
less [Medium -High] ; and 
(2) At least nine inches  when  the height  of highest  designated  play surface  is greater than 
five feet.  [Medium -High]  
(b) You must not install loose -fill surfacing materials over concrete or asphalt. [Medium - High]  
(c) You must mark all equipment support posts to indicate the depth at which the loose -fill 
surfacing material must be maintained under and around the equipment.  [Medium]  
(d) You must ensure the loose -fill materials are maintained at the proper depth at all  times.  
[Medium -High]  
(e) Loose -fill surfacing materials must not be used indoors.  [Medium -High]  
Technical Assistance  
• Loose -fill surfacing materials require special maintenance. Playgrounds should  be 
checked frequently to ensure surfacing has not displaced significantly, especially 
those areas most subject to displacements such as swings and slide exits. Rake 
loose -fill material back into place as  needed.  
• The Consumer Product Safety Commission recommends, when using any loose -fill 
material with the exception of shredded/recycled rubber, to install at least 9  inches 
since shallower depths are too easily displaced and compacted.

Guard approved life jackets, ring buoys, rescue tubes, and reaching poles or 
shepherd’s hooks.  
• Regarding paragraphs (6) and (7), all caregivers must provide constant visual 
supervision of children and remain undistracted and within arm’s reach while 
watching children in and around water. Adults can wear physical reminders that 
they are responsible for supervising children who are swimming and while there is 
access to water.  
• Regarding paragraph (8), the power of suction of a pool drain often requires that 
the pump be turned off before a child can be removed; therefore, immediate 
unobstructed access is necessary.  
• Regarding paragraph (9), block direct access to swimming pools and  remove any 
materials and furniture that can be moved by children and used to climb over

Technical Assistance  
• The installation of multiple barriers around swimming pools helps to restrict a child’s 
unsupervised access to water.  
• The American Academy of Pediatrics recognizes an effective barrier as one that prevents 
a child from getting over, under, or through it and keeps the children from gaining 
access to the pool or body of water.  
• Colin’s Hope, a water safety advocacy group, r ecommends that pools have 4 -sided 
isolation fencing at least six feet in height, with self -closing and self -latching gates. 
Isolation fencing completely surrounds a pool, isolating it from the yard and adjacent 
properties. Isolation fencing does not use th e center as a barrier.  
• Remember, nothing substitutes for constant visual supervision by an adult. However, 
securing every pool with a proper barrier offers an additional layer of protection

Technical Assistance  
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all infants and toddlers ride in a 
rear-facing child safety seat for as long as possible, until they reach the highest weight 
or height allowed by the child safety seat manufacturer.  
A safety belt is properly fitted if the lap portion of the belt fits low across the hips and 
pelvis and the shoulder portion fits across the middle shoulder and chest.  
Height and weight requirements for a child safety seat may vary depending on the 
brand of safety seat. To determine the type of safety restraint a child must use based 
on the child’s height or weight, the child -care center must consult and follow the 
manuf acturer specifications for whichever rear -facing, convertible, or forward -facing 
safety seat the center uses. This information can typically be found on the car seat or 
by referencing the manufacturer’s website.

at all times the vehicle is in motion.  [Medium -High]  
(b) All adult passengers in a vehicle transporting chi ldren, other than a  large school bus, 
must be properly restrained by safety belts.  [Medium -High]  
Technical Assistance  
Studies indicate the use of restraint devices while riding in a vehicle reduces the 
likelihood of a passenger involved in a vehicle crash suffering serious injury or death.  
§746.5611. May parents provide the safety seat equipment 
required for their child?  
Subchapter X, Transportation 
September 2003  
Yes. Parents may provide the safety seat system for use in transporting their child, provided 
the equipment is appropriate and can be properly secured in the vehicle. You must use the 
equipment according to manufacturer’s instructions. [Medium -High]  
Techni cal Assistance  
Safety restraints are effective in reducing death and injury when they are used properly. 
According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the best car safety seat is one 
that fits in the vehicle being used, fits the child being trans ported, has never been in a 
crash, and is used correctly every time.  
§746.5613. May I place more than one person in each

 §746.5615. May a child ride in a safety belt with a shoulder 
harness?  
Subchapter X, Transportation 
September 2003  
A child may ride in a safety belt with a shoulder harness if the shoulder harness goes across 
the child’s chest and not across the child’s face or neck. The lap belt should fit low across 
the child’s thighs or top of the legs and not across the child’s stomach area. Never put a 
shoulder belt under the child’s arm or behind the child’s b ack. If the lap belt and shoulder 
harness do not fit properly, a booster seat must be used. [High]

Yes. You must ensure the driver/caregivers have clear instructions in handling emergency 
breakdowns and accidents, including vehicle evacuation procedures, supervision of the 
children, and contacting emergency help. The director or designee in charge of th e child -
care center must know what action to take in responding to a transportation emergency 
call. [Medium -High]  
§746.5621. What communication requirements are there 
for a vehicle used to transport children?  
Subchapter X, Transportation

 §746.5625. When and how must I install and use an 
electronic  child safety alarm in a  vehicle?  
Subchapter X, Transportation 
March 2023 
(a) You must ensure that a vehicle purchased or leased on or after December  31, 2013, is 
equipped with an electronic child safety alarm  if: 
(1) The vehicle is designed to seat eight or more persons [High] ; and 
(2) Your operation uses the vehicle to transport children in care.  [High]  
(b) You are responsible for ensuring that the alarm is installed and  maintained  according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions. [High]  
(c) The alarm must be used at all times whenever a vehicle describe in  subsection  (a) of 
this section is used to transport a child in care. [High]  
(d) The driver of the vehicle or a designated employee must complete the following tasks 
before disabling the alarm from the rear of the vehicle : 
(1) Verify that all children have been accounted for [High ]; and  
(2) Conduct a physical walk -through and visual check of the vehicle, including the 
seats, seat rows, and interior , to ensure no children remain in the vehicle [High ]. 
Technical Assistance  
The electronic child safety alarm must not be disabled by a child. Only the driver or designated 
employee may disable the alarm.  
Electronic child safety alarms improve the safety of children in vehicles because they are 
designed to require a designated adult to walk through the vehicle to disable the alarm while 
conducting a visual check of the vehicle from front to back. This extra step helps ensure no 
child, especially a s leeping child, is left in the vehicle .

 Appendix II, Vaccine -Preventable Diseases  
This guide is intended  to provide you with more information to assist in the development 
and implementation of a vaccine -preventable disease policy for your program.  
What must the policy for protecting children from vaccine -
preventable diseases include?  
Your operation is respon sible for developing a policy that includes all areas addressed in  
§746.3611.  
How will Licensing evaluate for compliance?  
Licensing will review your program’s policy to ensure that it covers each of the eight 
required  areas. Licensing staff will ensure tha t your operation outlines how you will maintain 
either written or electronic records for each employee’s compliance with your policy as well 
as any exemptions. We will not evaluate based on the content of each policy item.  
What would be an example of how l icensing will evaluate 
my operation’s compliance with the new rule?  
The new rule requires you to specify any vaccines that you have determined an employee 
must have based on the level of risk the employee presents. Licensing staff will review your 
policy t o ensure you have specified any vaccines an employee must have. For example, if 
your policy outlines that all employees must only obtain a flu vaccine once every 12 months 
then we would only review compliance with the employee’s requirement to obtain a flu  
vaccine.  
What immunizations are recommended for adults?  
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) develops the recommendations and they are listed on the CDC website at 
http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/adult/adult -schedule.pdf  
Do I have to require employees to obtain all immunizations 
recommended by the CD C? 
No, employees at your program will only need to obtain immunizations that are required in 
your policy. It is up to you to determine what immunizations will be required and which 
employees are required to obtain them based on their level of risk as determined by their 
routine and direct exposure with children.  
Revised: 01/2025

303 
 How do I determine an employee’s level of risk?  
An employee’s level of risk is determined by the policy you develop. The basis for 
determining  an employee’s level of risk must be outlined in your policy and must be based 
on the  employee’s routine and direct exposure to children. Items to consider when you 
develop policy  include:  
• What are the employee’s primary  duties?  
• How closely does the employee work with children? (For example, does the 
employee change diapers, assist with toileting, prepare or serve  food)  
• How often does the employee work with children? (Regular contact vs. substitute  
basis)  
• What are the ages of children the employee works  with?  
Can an employee be exempt from imm unizations that my 
program’s  policy requires?  
Yes, an employee may be exempt from one or more of your program’s required 
immunizations for:  
• Medical conditions identified as contraindications or precautions by the CDC;  or 
• Reasons of conscience, including a religious  belief.  
What procedures must an employee follow to be exempt 
from having a required vaccine?  
Your policy must address exemption procedures an employee must follow in order for you  to 
determine the employee’s qualification of an exempt ion. 
What are some examples of acceptable documentation for 
exemptions?  
• For medical conditions, acceptable documentation may include a note from  the 
employee’s health care professional providing a statement that the required 
vaccine is medically contraindi cated or poses a significant risk to the health and 
well-being of the individual.  
• For reasons of  conscience,  acceptable  documentation  may include  a signed  and 
dated statement from the employee that states the employee is exempt for 
reasons  of conscience, including the person’s religious beliefs.  
Revised: 01/2025

304 
 What are some examples of procedures that an exempt 
employee must follow to protect children in care from 
exposure to disease?  
It is up to your operation to determine what and when protective procedures  will be 
required. Examples of protective procedures include:  
• Wearing gloves when handling or cleaning body fluids, such as after wiping  noses, 
mouths, or bottoms, and tending  sores;  
• Specifying that an employee with open wounds and/or any injury that inhib its hand 
washing, such as casts, bandages, or braces, must not prepare food or have close 
contact with children in  care;  
• Wearing  masks  when  the employee  has respiratory  symptoms  to reduce  the spread  
of droplets to surrounding  areas;  
• Wearing masks when taking care of children with respiratory  symptoms;  
• Removing gloves and washing hands immediately after each task to prevent  cross - 
contamination to other  children;  
• Excluding the employee from direct care when the employee has signs of  illness.  
How can I determine that an employee has complied with 
my operation’s policy?  
You must specify in your policy how you will verify that an employee has complied with your 
policy. This must include what written and/or electronic documentation you will accept.  
Examples of documentation may include:  
• Copy of the employee’s current immunization  record;  
• Receipt that includes date a required immunization was received;  
• Letter signed by a health care professional that lists the date an immunization  was 
received;  
• Docume ntation of exemption for medical reasons from a health care  professional;  
• Signed and dated statement from the employee for exemption based on a reason  
of conscience.  
Revised: 01/2025

305 
 Where can my employees get the recommended 
immunizations?  
Individuals should start with th eir health care provider. Other resources in your area include 
pharmacies, the health department, and public or community health clinics. For a list of 
local health departments in Texas visit the Texas Department of State Health Services 
(DSHS) website at:  http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/regions/lhds.shtm  
Are there any other resources available for employees to 
receive the recommended immunizations?  
Yes, the Adult  Safety Net program created by The Texas Department of State Health Services 
(DSHS) to increase access to vaccination services in Texas for uninsured adults.  
What is the Adult Safety Net program?  
The Adult Safety Net (ASN) program provides vaccine purchase d with public funds to 
participating clinics to be used for immunizing uninsured adults.  
How do I find an Adult Safety Net provider in my area?  
Visit the ASN website at www.dshs.state.tx.us/ASN  and click on the search page to locate an 
ASN clinic near you. (Please check with the clinic before visiting to make sure they can see you.)  
Who is e ligible to receive vaccinations from the ASN 
program?  
Adults ages 19 years and older that do not have health insurance are eligible to receive ASN 
vaccines.  
Who is not eligible to receive ASN vaccines?  
Individuals who do not qualify for ASN vaccines includ e: 
• Adults who have Medicare, Medicaid, or any other insurance, including private  
insurance.  
• Adults  who are underinsured  for adult vaccines  (e.g.,  those  who have healthcare 
insurance that does not cover adult  vaccines).  
• Individuals younger than 19 years of  age. 
Revised: 01/2025

306 
 What vaccines are offered through the ASN program?  
The following is a list of vaccines currently offered through the ASN program and a 
description of the diseases they prevent.  
• Hepatitis  B Vaccine  — prevents  infection  of the liver by the hepatitis  B virus,  which  
can lead to liver cancer, cirrhosis of the liver, liver failure, and  death.  
• Hepatitis A Vaccine — prevents infection of the liver by the hepatitis A virus. 
Symptoms of hepatitis A include lack of energy, diarrhea, fever, nausea and 
jaundice (yellow color to the whites of the eyes or  skin).  
• Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B Combination Vaccine —see above.  
• Human  Papillomavirus  (HPV)  Vaccine  — prevents  infection  from several  strains  of 
HPV, including those that cause genital warts and several types of cancer, such as 
cervical, anal, penile, and throat  cancer.  
• Measles/Mumps/Rubella (MMR) Vaccine — prevents infection from the measles 
virus, which  can lead to rash, ear infection,  brain damage,  and death.  Prevents  
infection  from the mumps virus, which can cause fever, swollen glands, headache, 
and can lead to deafness and meningitis. Prevents infection from rubella virus, 
which can cause rash, arthritis, and miscarriage in pregnant  women.  
• Pneumococcal Polysaccharide (PPSV23) Vaccine — prevents infection by the 
Streptococcus pneumoniae bacterium, which is one of the most common causes of 
severe  pneumonia  and can lead to other  types  of infections,  such as ear infections,  
sinus infections, meningitis (infection of the lining of the brain and spinal cord), 
and blood stream infections  (bacteremia).  
• Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis (Tdap) Vaccine — prevents tetanus, which can  
cause muscle spasms, lockjaw, paralysis, and deat h. Prevents diphtheria, which 
can cause suffocation and heart failure. Prevents pertussis (known as “whooping 
cough”), which can cause severe coughing that can lead to rib fractures, 
pneumonia, and death. The CDC recommends* one dose for all pregnant women  
during every pregnancy and all other adults who have not yet received Tdap 
vaccination, especially those who come in contact with  infants.  
• Tetanus  and Diphtheria  (Td) Vaccine — similar  to Tdap vaccine  (see above),  but 
protects against tetanus and diphtheria only, without the pertussis  component.  
Revised: 01/2025

307 
 If I qualify for ASN vaccine, do I have to pay anything?  
ASN vaccines are supplied to participating medical providers at no cost. This means that 
ASN providers cannot charge a fee for the vaccine itself. Ho wever, providers are allowed to 
charge an administration fee of up to $25 for each vaccine that is administered. Although 
ASN providers may charge this administration fee, they cannot deny the vaccine because of 
an inability to pay it.
