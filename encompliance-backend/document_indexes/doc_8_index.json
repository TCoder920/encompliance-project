All members of the public, including\nproviders, are encouraged to provide input when proposed minimum standards are published for public\ncomment. The  commission considers recommendations from interested persons or groups in formulating\nthe final draft, which is filed as rules with the Secretary of State.\nDeficiencies\nA deficiency is any failure to comply with a minimum standard, rule in Texas Administr ative Code Chapter\n745, law, specific term of the permit, or specific condition of probation or suspension.\nWeights\nThe minimum standards and rules are weighted based on a common understanding of the risk to\nchildren presented if the standard or rule is vi olated. The weights are high, medium -high, medium,\nmedium -low, and low. The assigned weights do not change based on the scope or severity of an\nactual deficiency. Scope and severity are assessed by Child Care Regulation (CCR) staff,\ndocumented, and conside red in conjunction with the weight when making CCR decisions. You will\nsee the weight is noted at the end of each standard or subsection in green. Only those minimum\nstandards and rules which can be cited as a deficiency are weighted. For example, the mini mum\nstandard prohibiting physical discipline is weighed but standards that are definitions are not\nweighted.\nRevised: 01/2025",

      "content": "7 Maintaining Compliance\nIt is essential that you, your employees, and your caregivers recognize four critical aspects of CCR’s\nefforts to protect th e children in care and to help operation employees and caregivers comply with\nthe law, rules, and standards. The four aspects are:\n●Inspection\n●Technical  assistance\n●Investigations\n●Caregiver’s rights and entitlements\nThe Inspection\nVarious aspects of regulated operations are evaluated for compliance with the minimum standards,\nrules, and law during regular inspections. The emphasis on these inspections is to prevent risk to\nchildren in care. The frequency of inspections will fluctuate depending on the type of permit and the\noperation’s history of compliance with the minimum standards, rules, and law.\nDuring any inspection, if we find that your operation does not meet minimum standard, rule, or law,\nthe deficiencies are discussed with the person in charg e at the time of the inspection. You will be\ngiven an opportunity to correct deficiencies within a specified period of time. If you have questions,\nconcerns, or disagree with the citation, we encourage you to talk with us before we leave your\noperation. If  your concerns are not resolved, you may request an administrative review.\nTechnical Assistance\nWe are available to offer consultation to potential applicants, applicants, and permit holders\nregarding how to comply with minimum standards, rules, and laws. While we most often provide\ntechnical assistance during inspections and investigations, technical assistance can be requested at\nany time.\nThe Child Care Regulation section of the HHSC website has a Technical Assistance Library that allows\nyou to view or d ownload information about a variety of topics related to child care. You can view it\nby going to https://hhs.texas.gov/doing -business -hhs/provider -portals/protective - services -\nproviders/child -care-licensing  and selecting Technical Assistance Library from t he Resources section.\nA feature of the minimum standards publication are the Technical Assistance boxes that follow certain\nminimum standards to provide additional guidance, clarification, resources, and/or best practices related\nto the applicable rule.\nRevised: 01/2025\n\n8\nInvestigations\nWhen a report alleges a violation of minimum standards, rule, or law, CCR must investigate the\nreport, notify you of the investigation, and provide a written report to you of the investigation\nresults within prescribed time frames.\nWhen a report alleges abuse, neglect, or exploitation, the Department of Family and Protective Services\nmust investigate the report, notify you of the investigation, and provide a written report to you of the\ninvestigation results within prescribed  time frames.\nYour Rights and Entitlements\nWaivers and Variances\nYou may request a waiver if your operation is unable to comply with a standard for economic\nreasons. You may request a variance if your operation wishes to meet the intent of a standard in a\nway that is different from what the standard specifies. Waiver and variance requests are submitted\nthrough your online provider account or made in writing to your assigned CCR inspector.\nAdministrative Review\nIf you disagree with a CCR decision or action, you may request an administrative review, during\nwhich you are given an opportunity to show compliance with applicable minimum standard, rule,\nlaw, action, permit restriction(s) and/or permit condition(s).\nAppeals\nYou may request an appeal hearing on a CCR  decision to deny an application, revoke, suspend, or\nrefuse to renew a permit or a condition placed on the permit after initial issuance.\nAppeal hearings are conducted by the State Office of Administrative Hearings (SOAH).\nFor Further Information\nIt is im portant that you, your employees, and your caregivers clearly understand the purpose of\nminimum standards and the reasons for CCR’s inspections and investigations. Do not hesitate to ask\nus questions that will help you understand any aspect of our regulati on. You may obtain information\nabout minimum standards or procedures by calling your local CCR office or by visiting the HHSC\nWebsite at https://hhs.texas.gov/doing -business -hhs/provider - portals/protective -services -\nproviders/child -care-licensing .\nRevised: 01/2025",

As long as a director has at least six hours of instructor -led training, a\ndirector who exceeds the minimum number of required hours can complete the extra hours\nthrough instructor -led or self -instructional training as determined by the director or child -\ncare center .\n• Regarding paragraph (j), most of a director’s training should come  from sources that allow\nan assessment of the director’s understanding and feedback from an instructor. While self -\nstudy from materials such as videos, books, and articles provides an opportunity for\ndirectors to expand knowledge on subjects of interest to  him or her and for which there\nmay not be an established training, this type of training does not assess what the director\nlearned. It is important that the majority of training come from sources that allow an\nassessment of the director’s understanding an d feedback from an instructor to ensure that\nthe director appropriately applies the information learned in a child care setting .\nRevised: 01/2025",

How do I determine the child/caregiver ratio?\nSubchapter E, Child/Caregiver Ratios and Group Sizes\nDivision 1, Ratios and Group Sizes at the Child -Care Center\nSeptember 2003\nIn determining child/caregiver ratio, the following apply:\n(1) Child/caregiver ratio is based on the specified age of the children in the caregiver’s group or\nthe age of the youngest child in the group, depending on the activity and  the number of\nchildren at the child -care center.  [Medium]\n(2) You may use the developmenta l or emotional age, rather than the chronological age, of a child\nwith special care needs, if this is recommended by a health -care professional or other qualified\nprofessional and is documented in the child’s record.  [Medium]\n(3) You must consider the skills of the  caregiver and the needs of the individual children and the\ngroup when assigning a caregiver to a group of children. For example, if a group of toddlers is\nexperiencing biting, consider assigning a caregiver who is trained to handle these beha viors\nand perhaps additional caregivers or volunteers to assist in the supervision and redirection of\nthe children.  [Medium]\n(4) You must include all children in care, including children related to the child -care center director\nand employees.  [Medium]\nRevised: 01/2025\n\n113\n(5) In emer gency situations, you may use child -care center employees who do not meet caregiver\nqualifications for a limited time while a substitute caregiver is being secured. The time must\nbe no longer than is reasonably necessary to secure a qualified  substitute caregiver.\nEmergency situations include, but are not limited to, illness, accident, or death. [Medium]\n(6) The total number of children in care at the center and in care away from the center, such as\nduring a field trip, must never exceed the licens ed capacity of the center.  [Medium -High]\nTechnical Assistance\nRegarding paragraph (2), it can be beneficial to adjust the child to caregiver ratio if you have a\nchild or children in care with special care needs. A child who may require additional supervis ion or\ncare may require more individualized attention or benefit from a smaller group.\nRevised: 01/2025",

Children under  24\nmonths are also at greater risk during an emergency requiring evacuation of the\ncenter.\n• Research indicates direct, warm, social interactions between adults and children\nare more likely to occur with lower child/caregiver  ratios.\n• According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), caregivers must be\nrecognized as performing a job for groups of children that p arents would rarely be\nconsidered capable of handling alone. Caring for a group of three infants is the  same\nas caring for infant triplets; four toddlers can be the equivalent to a set of\nquadruplets.\n§746.1603.

For example, if\nthe young est child in a group is eight months old, the oldest child in the group must not be more\nthan 26 months old;  [Medium -High]  or\n(2) If you have 12 or fewer children in care you may combine infants with older children without\nregard to age, as described in §746.1 703 of this subchapter (relating to If I have 12 or fewer\nchildren in care, may I combine infants with children 18 months and older?).\nTechnical Assistance\n• There are some programs that offer what is called “continuity of care” for infants and\ntoddlers. This is where a mixed age group made up of children between the ages of\nbirth through 35 months is cared for together from the time they enroll in the center\nuntil they turn three. Benefits of this arrangement include consistency in caregivers\nin a setting that resembles siblings within a family, as well as developmental and\ncurricular  advantages.\n• When infants are infrequently grouped with older children in a space not  specifically\ndesigned to meet their needs and without additional caregivers the re is increased\nrisk to their health and  safety.\n§746.1607.
