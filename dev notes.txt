6. Backend Integration for Chat Feature
Model Compatibility: Updated the backend to ensure compatibility with LM Studio instead of Ollama, focusing on the specific requirements of LM Studio.
API Adjustments: Modified the llm_service.py to handle the response format from LM Studio correctly, ensuring proper communication with the local LLM server.
Environment Configuration: Updated the .env file to set the correct LOCAL_MODEL_URL for LM Studio, ensuring the backend can connect to the local model.
7. Testing and Debugging
Server Management: Started both backend and frontend servers to test the chat feature, ensuring that all components were functioning together.
Error Analysis: Addressed errors related to the chat feature, specifically focusing on the response format from the local LLM server. This included:
Analyzing terminal output for error messages indicating issues with the 'choices' and 'response' fields.
Identifying that the backend code was failing to handle the response format correctly and proposing necessary adjustments.
Logging Enhancements: Added detailed logging to help diagnose issues with the LM Studio integration, capturing raw responses for better debugging.
8. LM Studio Specific Adjustments
Integration with LM Studio: Acknowledged the switch from Ollama to LM Studio, which required specific adjustments in the backend code to accommodate differences in API structure.
Functionality Updates: Implemented new functions in llm_service.py to handle requests to the LM Studio API with the appropriate message format.
Error Handling: Enhanced error handling to manage different response formats from LM Studio, including logging the raw response for debugging purposes.
9. Final Configuration and Testing
Environment Variable Updates: Ensured that the backend environment file was correctly configured to match LM Studio's default endpoint.
Server Restart: Suggested restarting the backend server to apply recent changes made for LM Studio, confirming that the server was active and ready for further interactions.
10. Current Status
The backend is now configured to work specifically with LM Studio, and the chat feature should be functional.
Ongoing monitoring and debugging are in place to ensure smooth operation, with detailed logs available for troubleshooting any future issues.

Comprehensive Project Overview and Debugging History
1. Project Structure and Components
The project consists of several key components:
Backend: A FastAPI-based server (encompliance-backend/)
Frontend: A React-based web application (encompliance-frontend/)
Documents Storage: A dedicated folder for PDF documents (encompliance-documents/)
Error Logs: A directory containing various error logs (encompliance-error logs/)
2. Initial Authentication Issues
Problem Identification
The project initially faced significant authentication issues, primarily related to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy violations. These issues were identified through error logs in the encompliance-error logs directory.
Error Analysis
We examined multiple error logs:
acces error.log
fetching error.log
api error.log
get error.log
All logs showed similar CORS-related errors, specifically:
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users/me' from origin 'http://localhost:5173' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
This indicated that the frontend (running on port 5173) couldn't access the backend API (running on port 8000) due to CORS restrictions.
Root Cause Analysis
The root causes were identified as:
Missing CORS headers in backend responses
Improper handling of preflight OPTIONS requests
Issues with token authentication between frontend and backend
Lack of proper error handling for network requests
3. Authentication Fixes Implemented
Backend Improvements
Created a dedicated user-info endpoint:
Added a new /users/user-info endpoint in users.py
Implemented explicit CORS headers in the response
Added proper serialization of user data to JSON
Added OPTIONS request handler:
Implemented an OPTIONS handler for preflight requests
Set appropriate CORS headers:
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:5173
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization, Content-Type, x-token
Access-Control-Max-Age: 600
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Enhanced error handling:
Added logging for authentication requests
Improved error responses with appropriate status codes
Frontend Improvements
Enhanced API Service:
Added a robust getUserInfo() method to authApi in api.ts
Implemented a multi-tiered approach to fetch user data:
First attempt: New /users/user-info endpoint
Second attempt: Standard /users/me endpoint
Third attempt: Direct axios request
Updated User Service:
Modified getCurrentUser() in userService.ts to use the new getUserInfo() method
Improved error handling with clear user messages
Added token clearing on authentication failure
Debugging Enhancements:
Added extensive console logging throughout the authentication flow
Implemented fallback mechanisms for authentication failures
4. Testing and Verification
We started both the backend and frontend servers to test our changes:
Backend: uvicorn app.main:app --reload (running on port 8000)
Frontend: npm run dev (running on port 5173)
We verified that the backend server was running by checking the process list.
5. PDF-Related Requirements (Not Yet Implemented)
Based on the requirements provided, the following PDF-related features need to be implemented:
Database Model for PDF Metadata:
File name, path, upload/deletion timestamps, user IDs
API Endpoints:
/pdfs/upload: For authenticated users to upload PDFs
/pdfs/list: To list available PDFs (with chapter-746-centers.pdf first)
/pdfs/download/{pdf_id}: To retrieve specific PDFs
/pdfs/delete/{pdf_id}: To delete PDFs with audit logging
Frontend Components:
PDF listing interface
Upload functionality
Download capability
Delete option with UI updates
LLM Integration for PDF Content:
Text extraction from PDFs
Content indexing for search
Integration with LLM for answering compliance questions
Citation mechanism for referencing specific documents
6. Current Status and Next Steps
Completed:
Authentication issues have been diagnosed and fixed
CORS configuration has been properly implemented
Token handling has been improved
Error logging and handling have been enhanced
Pending:
Implementation of PDF storage and metadata in PostgreSQL
Creation of PDF-related API endpoints
Frontend components for PDF management
LLM integration for querying PDF content
Audit logging for PDF actions
The next logical step would be to implement the PDF-related features, starting with the database model and API endpoints, followed by the frontend components and LLM integration.
7. Additional Considerations for LLM Integration
For the LLM to effectively query PDF data:
We need to prioritize accuracy, relevance, and quality over context window utilization
Implement selective content extraction that preserves document structure
Develop intelligent retrieval mechanisms that prioritize relevance
Create a thoughtful response generation system with proper citations
Establish quality assurance mechanisms to ensure accurate information
The large 128K token context window provides flexibility, but the focus should remain on delivering high-quality, relevant information to users rather than maximizing the amount of text included.
