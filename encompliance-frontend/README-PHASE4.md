# Phase 4: Home Link Navigation Changes

## Overview
This phase modifies the Home button behavior to direct users to the landing page (before signing in), while still displaying dashboard access, user profile, and AI model links if the user is logged in.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified App.tsx
- Removed the automatic redirection from home to dashboard for authenticated users
- This allows authenticated users to view the landing page when clicking the Home button

### 2. Enhanced HomePage.tsx
- Added authentication state check using the `useAuth` hook
- Added a new dashboard access section that appears only for authenticated users
- Modified the hero section to show different buttons based on authentication status:
  - "Go to Dashboard" for authenticated users
  - "Get Started" for non-authenticated users
- Made the "How It Works" section conditional, showing only for non-authenticated users
- Kept the features/slogans section visible for all users

## Testing
To verify the changes:
1. Log in to the application
2. Click the Home button in the navigation bar
3. Verify that you are directed to the landing page, not the dashboard
4. Confirm that you can see the dashboard access section with links to:
   - Dashboard
   - View Minimum Standards
   - User Profile
5. Log out and verify that the landing page shows the "Get Started" button and "How It Works" section

## Benefits
- Improved user experience by allowing users to access the landing page at any time
- Better navigation flow that maintains access to important features
- Clearer distinction between authenticated and non-authenticated user experiences
